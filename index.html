        <p>My Name is Ryan Burns and I am a Full Stack Developer in training. I was born in Orlando Florida on June 17th 1993 making me 
            one of very few Florida Natives. 
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p> My interest in becoming a developer began my freshman year of college. I was one of those students that would never go to class 
            if I could get away with not doing so. Unfortunately, like most students who take this approach, I began to miss important lectures
            and as a result had literally no useful notes when it came time to study for exams. Rather than just doing what was expected of me 
            and going to class, I began to brainstorm on loopholes instead. In my mind there had to be some way that I could skip class and still
            have pages full of notes at the ready when I needed them. That very next day I began illustrating an app that could solve my problems.
            I drew out what each screen would look, how users would interact with eachother on zthe site itself and even how to monetize my creation. 
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>The next step was clear...I had to learn how to build this thing. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I tried numerous times
            to teach myself basic html, css and javascript. I struggled with the amount of content out there and quickly became overwhelmed by the 
            task ahead of me. I put the idea, and the task of learning to code on the backburner and proceeded with my life for the next 7 years.
            Now here we are 7 years later, I've enrolled in the UCF Coding Bootcamp and have committed myself to learning how to be a developer....
            and yes, I still plan on building my App!
